# XFit
A program for Wide X-ray Angle Diffraction（WAXD）batch analysis
======================================================================================
This repo is designed for researchers engaged in synchrotron X-ray characterization, enabling them to analyze and process their large amounts of data more efficiently. The current main supported functions are:

1. Calculation of amorphous region and crystal type content;
2. Calculation of grain size;
3. Calculation of orientation index.

'main.py' is the main program of the program, while other 'xxx.py' files are subprograms.

This version is not the final one. The folder is still being refined and updated. We sincerely welcome suggestions for modifications from all users.
