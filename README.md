# XFit
An batch processing procedure for Wide X-ray Angle Diffraction（WAXD）

This repo is designed for researchers engaged in synchrotron X-ray characterization, enabling them to analyze and process their large amounts of data more efficiently. The current main supported functions are:

1. Calculation of amorphous region and crystal type content;
2. Calculation of grain size;
3. Calculation of orientation index.

This version is not the final one. The folder is still being refined and updated. We sincerely welcome suggestions for modifications from all users.
